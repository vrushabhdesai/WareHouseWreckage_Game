# WareHouseWreckage Game

## About 
Welcome to my first game developed in Unreal Engine 5.1.1! The game is all about destruction, and your mission is to knock down a stack of barrels inside an enclosed warehouse. You'll have only 40 cannon balls to accomplish this task, so it's crucial to aim your shots carefully. This game will put your aiming skills to the test. If you fail, the game will restart in just 5 seconds, so make sure all your shots count!
